   abstract = {Flotation is used to enrich indium tin oxide from the colour filter glass of waste liquid crystal display panels. Contact angle measurement and infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that colour filter contained hydrophobic methyl groups and aromatic ring. Crushing experiment and backscatter imaging analysis revealed that the colour filter with indium tin oxide almost separated from the glass substrate with size fraction of −0.032 mm. The proportion of particles in the −0.032 mm fraction increased with increasing grinding time. A sufficient dissociation was found between the colour filter with indium tin oxide and the glass substrate, and the indium content in the fine size fraction also increased. Moreover, the indium content, indium tin oxide concentrate yield and indium tin oxide recovery increased with decreasing feed size. The indium content of the indium tin oxide concentrate reached 0.61%, the indium tin oxide recovery peaked at 85.21% and the enrichment ratio was 16.6 in particles with size below 0.025 mm. Furthermore, the indium content, indium tin oxide concentrate yield and indium tin oxide recovery increased with increasing grinding time. After 80 min of grinding, the indium tin oxide recovery peaked at 92.51%, the indium content of the indium tin oxide concentrate reached 0.60% and the enrichment ratio was 18.4.},

However, the microscopic discontinuities require AgNWs be attached to some carrier for practical applications. Relative to the preparation method, how to integrate AgNWs into the flexible matrix is particularly important. In recent years, plenty of papers have been published on the preparation of conductors based on AgNWs, including printing techniques, coating techniques, vacuum filtration techniques, template-assisted assembly techniques, electrospinning techniques and gelating techniques. The aim of this review is to discuss different assembly method of AgNW-based conducting film and their advantages.

   abstract = {We report a comprehensive study of transparent and conductive silver nanowire (Ag NW) electrodes, including a scalable fabrication process, morphologies, and optical, mechanical adhesion, and flexibility properties, and various routes to improve the performance. We utilized a synthesis specifically designed for long and thin wires for improved performance in terms of sheet resistance and optical transmittance. Twenty Ω/sq and ∼ 80% specular transmittance, and 8 ohms/sq and 80% diffusive transmittance in the visible range are achieved, which fall in the same range as the best indium tin oxide (ITO) samples on plastic substrates for flexible electronics and solar cells. The Ag NW electrodes show optical transparencies superior to ITO for near-infrared wavelengths (2-fold higher transmission). Owing to light scattering effects, the Ag NW network has the largest difference between diffusive transmittance and specular transmittance when compared with ITO and carbon nanotube electrodes, a property which could greatly enhance solar cell performance. A mechanical study shows that Ag NW electrodes on flexible substrates show excellent robustness when subjected to bending. We also study the electrical conductance of Ag nanowires and their junctions and report a facile electrochemical method for a Au coating to reduce the wire-to-wire junction resistance for better overall film conductance. Simple mechanical pressing was also found to increase the NW film conductance due to the reduction of junction resistance. The overall properties of transparent Ag NW electrodes meet the requirements of transparent electrodes for many applications and could be an immediate ITO replacement for flexible electronics and solar cells. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {On the long road towards low‑cost flexible hybrid electronics, integration and printable solar energy harvesting solutions, there is an urgent need for high‑performance transparent conductive electrodes produced using manufacturing‑ready techniques and equipment. In recent years, randomly‑ distributed metallic nanowire‑based transparent mesh electrodes have proven highly‑promising as they offer a superb compromise between high performances and low fabrication costs. Unfortunately, these high figure‑of‑merit transparent mesh electrodes usually rely heavily on extensive post‑ deposition processing. While conventional thermal annealing yields good performances, it is especially ill‑suited for deposition on low‑temperature substrates or for high‑throughput manufacturing solutions. Similarly, laser‑induced annealing severely limits the processing time for electrodes covering large surfaces. In this paper, we report the fabrication of ultra high‑performance silver nanowires‑based transparent conductive electrodes fabricated using optimized manufacturing‑ready ultrafast photonic curing solutions. Using conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) as our benchmark for transparent electrodes, we demonstrate a 2.6–2.7 × performance gain using two different figure‑of‑ merit indicators. Based on these results, we believe this research provides an ideal manufacturing‑ ready approach for the large‑scale and low‑cost fabrication of ultra high‑performance transparent electrodes for flexible hybrid electronics and solar‑energy harvesting applications.},

A promising approach is the combination of transparent conducting electrode materials (e.g., silver nanowires, AgNWs) and upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs). Here, electrochromic devices based on transparent nanocomposite films of poly(methyl methacrylate) and AgNWs covered by UCNPs of different sizes and compositions are developed. By combining the electrical control of the heat dissipation in AgNW networks with size-dependent thermal properties of UCNPs, tunable electrochromic transparent devices covering a broad range of the chromatic diagrams are fabricated.

Moreover, by defining a new thermometric parameter involving the intensity ratio of transitions of large- and small-sized UCNPs, a relative thermal sensitivity of 5.88% K −1 (at 339 K) is obtained, a sixfold improvement over the values reported so far.},

A wide variety of color combinations are possible with suitable thermochromic material selection.

A low processing temperature of 100 °C makes the composite compatible with a wide range of flexible substrates such as paper and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The material (encapsulated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) exhibits good flexibility and is observed to be functional after 10 000 bending cycles with <7% resistance change. We have fabricated a low-power seven-segment color display to show the material's suitability for practical display applications. We have also demonstrated that the same layer can function as a display and as a touch sensor because of its conducting and chromatic properties without additional active layers on top.

Silver nanowires with two different average lengths (11 $\mu$m and 19 $\mu$m) were used in the sample preparation to analyze the dependence of the sheet resistance on the length of the one-dimensional nanostructures. The best sample had a sheet resistance of 10.2$\Omega$/□ with optical transmittance of 89.9.

@article{Miccoli2015,
abstract = {The electrical conductivity of solid-state matter is a fundamental physical property and can be precisely derived from the resistance measured via the four-point probe technique excluding contributions from parasitic contact resistances. Over time, this method has become an interdisciplinary characterization tool in materials science, semiconductor industries, geology, physics, etc, and is employed for both fundamental and application-driven research. However, the correct derivation of the conductivity is a demanding task which faces several difficulties, e.g. the homogeneity of the sample or the isotropy of the phases. In addition, these sample-specific characteristics are intimately related to technical constraints such as the probe geometry and size of the sample. In particular, the latter is of importance for nanostructures which can now be probed technically on very small length scales. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the four-point probe technique, introduced by Frank Wenner, in this review we revisit and discuss various correction factors which are mandatory for an accurate derivation of the resistivity from the measured resistance. Among others, sample thickness, dimensionality, anisotropy, and the relative size and geometry of the sample with respect to the contact assembly are considered. We are also able to derive the correction factors for 2D anisotropic systems on circular finite areas with variable probe spacings. All these aspects are illustrated by state-of-the-art experiments carried out using a four-tip STM/SEM system. We are aware that this review article can only cover some of the most important topics. Regarding further aspects, e.g. technical realizations, the influence of inhomogeneities or different transport regimes, etc, we refer to other review articles in this field.},

    abstract = { Silver nanowire mesh electrodes represent a possible mass-manufacturable route toward transparent and flexible electrodes for plastic-based electronics such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and others. Here we describe a route that is based upon spray-coated silver nanowire meshes on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets that are treated with a straightforward combination of heat and pressure to generate electrodes that have low sheet resistance, good optical transmission, that are topologically flat, and adhere well to the PET substrate. The silver nanowire meshes were prepared by spray-coating a solution of silver nanowires onto PET, in air at slightly elevated temperatures. The as-prepared silver nanowire electrodes are highly resistive due to the poor contact between the individual silver nanowires. Light pressure applied with a stainless steel rod, rolled over the as-sprayed silver nanowire meshes on PET with a speed of 10 cm s–1 and a pressure of 50 psi, results in silver nanowire mesh arrays with sheet resistances of less than 20 Ω/□. Bending of these rolled nanowire meshes on PET with different radii of curvature, from 50 to 0.625 mm, showed no degradation of the conductivity of the electrodes, as shown by the constant sheet resistance before and after bending. Repeated bending (100 times) around a rod with a radius of curvature of 1 mm also showed no increase in the sheet resistance, demonstrating good adherence and no signs of delamination of the nanowire mesh array. The diffuse and direct transmittance of the silver nanowires (both rolled and as-sprayed) was measured for wavelengths from 350 to 1200 nm, and the diffuse transmission was similar to that of the PET substrate; the direct transmission decreases by about 7–8\%. The silver nanowires were then incorporated into OPV devices with the following architecture: transparent electrode/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al. While slightly lower in efficiency than the standard indium tin oxide substrate (ITO), the rolled silver nanowire electrodes had a very good device yield, showing that short circuits resulting from the silver nanowire electrodes can be successfully avoided by this rolling approach. }

@article{Jiang2019,
abstract = {Flexible and stretchable conducting composites that can sense stress or strain are needed for several emerging fields including human motion detection and personalized health monitoring. Silver nanowires (AgNWs) have already been used as conductive networks. However, once a traditional polymer is broken, the conductive network is subsequently destroyed. Integrating high pressure sensitivity and repeatable self-healing capability into flexible strain sensors represents new advances for high performance strain sensing. Herein, superflexible 3D architectures are fabricated by sandwiching a layer of AgNWs decorated self-healing polymer between two layers of polydimethylsiloxane, which exhibit good stability, self-healability, and stretchability. For better mechanical properties, the self-healing polymer is reinforced with carbon fibers (CFs). The sensors based on self-healing polymer and AgNWs conductive network show high conductivity and excellent ability to repair both mechanical and electrical damage. They can detect different human motions accurately such as bending and recovering of the forearm and shank, the changes of palm, fist, and fingers. The fracture tensile stress of the reinforced self-healing polymer (9 wt% CFs) is increased to 10.3 MPa with the elongation at break of 8%. The stretch/release responses under static and dynamic loads of the sensor have a high sensitivity, large sensing range, excellent reliability, and remarkable stability.},

abstract = {In this work, a simple dip-coating method is developed to form silver nanowire conductive networks on cotton fibers due to the hydrogen bonding between them, and conductive cotton sheets with high conductivity (10-4-10-5 $\Omega$ cm) and durability (agitated for more than 1500 min) are obtained to construct flexible pressure sensors. The fabrication process is of low cost and can be easily scaled up, and the bio-based flexible pressure sensors show very high sensitivity (3.4 kPa-1), rapid response and relaxation time (<50 ms) and excellent stability (>5000 loading/unloading cycles). The working mechanism is theoretically studied and the results demonstrate that the layers of conductive cotton sheets play a key role in determining the performance of the flexible pressure sensors because it is closely related to the contact points. The flexible pressure sensors can effectively detect dynamic sound-driven vibrations (0.006 dB-1), gentle external forces and muscle motions, illustrating their extensive applications in various fields such as voice recognition and robotic systems.},

The array design and application based on flexible strain sensors have been the current research hotspots. However, there are few reports on research of acoustic positioning using the flexible sensor array. Herein, we designed and realized the consistent fabrication of a thin-film, acoustic sensor array. The acoustic sensing research of the sensor was demonstrated as well. We used a convenient fabrication method to design a flexible acoustic sensor using silver nanowires coated on a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film with mass block-beam structure. The acoustic sensor can record sound within a frequency domain of 20-2000 Hz and volume detection range of 83-108 dB. The sensor's resonance frequency is 380 Hz, horizontal distance sound detection limit is 5 cm, and vertical detection limit is 3.5 cm. We also achieved 360° azimuth detection in two-dimensional space with a detection accuracy of 15°. In three-dimensional space, the flexible acoustic sensor array was designed with two flexible acoustic sensors to detect the position of the sound source. This research first proposes the use of flexible acoustic sensors to test the sound source orientation.},

abstract = {A healable transparent capacitive touch screen sensor has been fabricated based on a healable silver nanowire-polymer composite electrode. The composite electrode features a layer of silver nanowire percolation network embedded into the surface layer of a polymer substrate comprising an ultrathin soldering polymer layer to confine the nanowires to the surface of a healable Diels-Alder cycloaddition copolymer and to attain low contact resistance between the nanowires. The composite electrode has a figure-of-merit sheet resistance of 18 $\omega$/sq with 80% transmittance at 550 nm. A surface crack cut on the conductive surface with 18 $\omega$ is healed by heating at 100 °C, and the sheet resistance recovers to 21 $\omega$ in 6 min. A healable touch screen sensor with an array of 8 × 8 capacitive sensing points is prepared by stacking two composite films patterned with 8 rows and 8 columns of coupling electrodes at 90° angle. After deliberate damage, the coupling electrodes recover touch sensing function upon heating at 80 °C for 30 s. A capacitive touch screen based on Arduino is demonstrated capable of performing quick recovery from malfunction caused by a razor blade cutting. After four cycles of cutting and healing, the sensor array remains functional.},

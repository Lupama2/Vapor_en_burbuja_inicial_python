   abstract = {A critical review of the previously known physical mechanisms of the optical breakdown of transparent liquids is presented. New ideas about this phenomenon are suggested and developed. These new ideas are based on the existence of clusters in the liquid. These clusters are generated from the stable microbubbles of gas (bubstons) that are dissolved in the liquid. The optical breakdown of liquid is the process of the stimulated coalescence of clusters by laser radiation, which is accompanied by a light flash (laser spark), the generation of spherical acoustic waves, the formation of "large" gas bubbles (cavitation), and the yield of liquid evaporation products. Within the framework of the developed ideas, many experimental facts about liquid breakdown are explained, such as its multiplex character and the sporadic regime of the breakdown under certain conditions.},

In the model, the temperature is assumed to be spatially uniform inside the bubble except at the thermal boundary layer near the bubble wall even at the strong collapse based on the theoretical results of Kwak and Na Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 4454 1996. In the model, the effect of the kinetic energy of gases inside the bubble is taken into account, which heats up the whole bubble when gases stop their motions at the end of the strong collapse. In the model, a bubble in water containing air is assumed to consist mainly of argon based on the hypothesis of Lohse et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 1359 1997. Numerical calculations under a SBSL condition reveal that the kinetic energy of gases heats up the whole bubble considerably. It is also clarified that vapor molecules (H 2 O) undergo chemical reactions in the heated interior of the bubble at the collapse and that chemical reactions decrease the temperature inside the bubble considerably. It is suggested that SBSL originates in thermal radiation from the whole bubble rather than a local point the bubble center heated by a converging spherical shock wave widely suggested in the previous theories of SBSL.},

   abstract = {Analytical and numerical analyses have been made of the physical behaviour of a collapsing bubble in a liquid. The mathematical formulation takes into account the effects of compressibility of the liquid, non-equilibrium condensation of the rapour, heat conduction and the temperature discontinuity a t the phase interface. Numerical solutions for the collapse of the bubble are obtained beyond the time when the bubble reaches its minimum radius up to the stage when a pressure wave forms and propagates outward into the liquid. The numerical results indicate that evaporation and condensation strongly influence the dynamical behaviour of the bubble. In addition, the propagation of the stress wave, both in a solid and a liquid, due to the collapse of the bubble has been observed by means of the dynamic photoelasticity. It is clearly demonstrated that the stress wave in a photoelastic specimen is caused by impact of the pressure wave radiated from the bubble.},

What are stiff problems? Where do they arise? How can we recognize them? Second we describe the characteristics shared by methods for the numerical solution of stiff problems. These characteristics have important implications as to the convenience and efficiency of solution of even routine problems. Understanding them is indispensable to the assembling of codes for the very efficient solution of special problems or for solving exceptionally large problems at all.

A sufficient dissociation was found between the colour filter with indium tin oxide and the glass substrate, and the indium content in the fine size fraction also increased. Moreover, the indium content, indium tin oxide concentrate yield and indium tin oxide recovery increased with decreasing feed size. The indium content of the indium tin oxide concentrate reached 0.61%, the indium tin oxide recovery peaked at 85.21% and the enrichment ratio was 16.6 in particles with size below 0.025 mm.

   abstract = {We report a comprehensive study of transparent and conductive silver nanowire (Ag NW) electrodes, including a scalable fabrication process, morphologies, and optical, mechanical adhesion, and flexibility properties, and various routes to improve the performance. We utilized a synthesis specifically designed for long and thin wires for improved performance in terms of sheet resistance and optical transmittance. Twenty Ω/sq and ∼ 80% specular transmittance, and 8 ohms/sq and 80% diffusive transmittance in the visible range are achieved, which fall in the same range as the best indium tin oxide (ITO) samples on plastic substrates for flexible electronics and solar cells. The Ag NW electrodes show optical transparencies superior to ITO for near-infrared wavelengths (2-fold higher transmission). Owing to light scattering effects, the Ag NW network has the largest difference between diffusive transmittance and specular transmittance when compared with ITO and carbon nanotube electrodes, a property which could greatly enhance solar cell performance. A mechanical study shows that Ag NW electrodes on flexible substrates show excellent robustness when subjected to bending. We also study the electrical conductance of Ag nanowires and their junctions and report a facile electrochemical method for a Au coating to reduce the wire-to-wire junction resistance for better overall film conductance. Simple mechanical pressing was also found to increase the NW film conductance due to the reduction of junction resistance. The overall properties of transparent Ag NW electrodes meet the requirements of transparent electrodes for many applications and could be an immediate ITO replacement for flexible electronics and solar cells. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {On the long road towards low‑cost flexible hybrid electronics, integration and printable solar energy harvesting solutions, there is an urgent need for high‑performance transparent conductive electrodes produced using manufacturing‑ready techniques and equipment. In recent years, randomly‑ distributed metallic nanowire‑based transparent mesh electrodes have proven highly‑promising as they offer a superb compromise between high performances and low fabrication costs. Unfortunately, these high figure‑of‑merit transparent mesh electrodes usually rely heavily on extensive post‑ deposition processing. While conventional thermal annealing yields good performances, it is especially ill‑suited for deposition on low‑temperature substrates or for high‑throughput manufacturing solutions. Similarly, laser‑induced annealing severely limits the processing time for electrodes covering large surfaces. In this paper, we report the fabrication of ultra high‑performance silver nanowires‑based transparent conductive electrodes fabricated using optimized manufacturing‑ready ultrafast photonic curing solutions. Using conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) as our benchmark for transparent electrodes, we demonstrate a 2.6–2.7 × performance gain using two different figure‑of‑ merit indicators. Based on these results, we believe this research provides an ideal manufacturing‑ ready approach for the large‑scale and low‑cost fabrication of ultra high‑performance transparent electrodes for flexible hybrid electronics and solar‑energy harvesting applications.},

abstract = {Sensitivity and transparency are critical properties for flexible and wearable electronic devices, and how to engineer both these properties simultaneously is dramatically essential. Here, for the first time, we report the assembly of ordered array structures of silver nanowires (AgNWs) via a simple water-bath pulling method to align the AgNWs embedded on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Compared with sensors prepared by direct drop-casting or transfer-printing methods, our developed sensor represents a considerable breakthrough in both sensitivity and transparency. The maximum transmittance was 86.3% at a wavelength of 550 nm, and the maximum gauge factor was as high as 84.6 at a strain of 30%. This remarkably sensitive and transparent flexible sensor has strictly stable and reliable responses to motion capture and human body signals; it is also expected to be able to help monitor disabled physical conditions or assist medical therapy while ensuring privacy protection.},

abstract = {Anovel nanocomposite resist is presented based on AgNWs dispersed in poly(methyl methacrylate). It is shown that this nanocomposite resist displays sheet resistances below 10 O sq-1 for concentrations of AgNWs higher than 4%wt and can be used for a wide range of microfabrication techniques. The resist can act as a conductive ink that cures at room temperature, form thin films with low sheet resistances, and be used in fast replication methods derived from soft lithography. Furthermore, it can be applied for nano-scale fabrication via electron beam lithography (EBL) on different substrates, includingflexible and insulating materials, providing a straightforward method to avoid charging effects. This, being the first report about a nanocomposite resist based on AgNWs for EBL, describes a simple procedure to account for suspended nanowires, forming bridges, nanocantilevers and more complex nanostructures. A wide range of opportunities opens for the single-step fabrication of electronic components in the nano and micro scale.},

abstract = {The hasty progress in smart, portable, flexible, and transparent integrated electronics and optoelectronics is currently one of the driving forces in nanoscience and nanotechnology. A promising approach is the combination of transparent conducting electrode materials (e.g., silver nanowires, AgNWs) and upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs). Here, electrochromic devices based on transparent nanocomposite films of poly(methyl methacrylate) and AgNWs covered by UCNPs of different sizes and compositions are developed. By combining the electrical control of the heat dissipation in AgNW networks with size-dependent thermal properties of UCNPs, tunable electrochromic transparent devices covering a broad range of the chromatic diagrams are fabricated. As illustrative examples, devices mixing large-sized (>70 nm) $\beta$-NaYF 4 :Yb,Ln and small-sized (<15 nm) NaGdF 4 :Yb,Ln@NaYF 4 core@shell UCNPs (Ln = Tm, Er, Ce/Ho) are presented, permitting to monitor the temperature-dependent emission of the particles by the intensity ratio of the Er 3+ 2 H 11/2 and 4 S 3/2 → 4 I 15/2 emission lines, while externally controlling the current flow in the AgNW network. Moreover, by defining a new thermometric parameter involving the intensity ratio of transitions of large- and small-sized UCNPs, a relative thermal sensitivity of 5.88% K −1 (at 339 K) is obtained, a sixfold improvement over the values reported so far.},

In this work, we have developed a composite electrothermochromic material consisting of silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and thermochromic powders, which exhibits reversible color (phase) change during biasing due to Joule heating. A wide variety of color combinations are possible with suitable thermochromic material selection. We have formulated this composite material as a printable ink so that patterned deposition can be achieved in a single step. A low processing temperature of 100 °C makes the composite compatible with a wide range of flexible substrates such as paper and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The material (encapsulated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) exhibits good flexibility and is observed to be functional after 10 000 bending cycles with <7% resistance change. We have fabricated a low-power seven-segment color display to show the material's suitability for practical display applications. We have also demonstrated that the same layer can function as a display and as a touch sensor because of its conducting and chromatic properties without additional active layers on top. The material is suitable for the fabrication of low-cost, flexible touch color displays for interactive electronic readers, digital posters, and flexible digital signboards.},

abstract = {The electrical conductivity of solid-state matter is a fundamental physical property and can be precisely derived from the resistance measured via the four-point probe technique excluding contributions from parasitic contact resistances. Over time, this method has become an interdisciplinary characterization tool in materials science, semiconductor industries, geology, physics, etc, and is employed for both fundamental and application-driven research. However, the correct derivation of the conductivity is a demanding task which faces several difficulties, e.g. the homogeneity of the sample or the isotropy of the phases. In addition, these sample-specific characteristics are intimately related to technical constraints such as the probe geometry and size of the sample. In particular, the latter is of importance for nanostructures which can now be probed technically on very small length scales. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the four-point probe technique, introduced by Frank Wenner, in this review we revisit and discuss various correction factors which are mandatory for an accurate derivation of the resistivity from the measured resistance. Among others, sample thickness, dimensionality, anisotropy, and the relative size and geometry of the sample with respect to the contact assembly are considered. We are also able to derive the correction factors for 2D anisotropic systems on circular finite areas with variable probe spacings. All these aspects are illustrated by state-of-the-art experiments carried out using a four-tip STM/SEM system. We are aware that this review article can only cover some of the most important topics. Regarding further aspects, e.g. technical realizations, the influence of inhomogeneities or different transport regimes, etc, we refer to other review articles in this field.},

    abstract = { Silver nanowire mesh electrodes represent a possible mass-manufacturable route toward transparent and flexible electrodes for plastic-based electronics such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and others. Here we describe a route that is based upon spray-coated silver nanowire meshes on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets that are treated with a straightforward combination of heat and pressure to generate electrodes that have low sheet resistance, good optical transmission, that are topologically flat, and adhere well to the PET substrate. The silver nanowire meshes were prepared by spray-coating a solution of silver nanowires onto PET, in air at slightly elevated temperatures. The as-prepared silver nanowire electrodes are highly resistive due to the poor contact between the individual silver nanowires. Light pressure applied with a stainless steel rod, rolled over the as-sprayed silver nanowire meshes on PET with a speed of 10 cm s–1 and a pressure of 50 psi, results in silver nanowire mesh arrays with sheet resistances of less than 20 Ω/□. Bending of these rolled nanowire meshes on PET with different radii of curvature, from 50 to 0.625 mm, showed no degradation of the conductivity of the electrodes, as shown by the constant sheet resistance before and after bending. Repeated bending (100 times) around a rod with a radius of curvature of 1 mm also showed no increase in the sheet resistance, demonstrating good adherence and no signs of delamination of the nanowire mesh array. The diffuse and direct transmittance of the silver nanowires (both rolled and as-sprayed) was measured for wavelengths from 350 to 1200 nm, and the diffuse transmission was similar to that of the PET substrate; the direct transmission decreases by about 7–8\%. The silver nanowires were then incorporated into OPV devices with the following architecture: transparent electrode/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al. While slightly lower in efficiency than the standard indium tin oxide substrate (ITO), the rolled silver nanowire electrodes had a very good device yield, showing that short circuits resulting from the silver nanowire electrodes can be successfully avoided by this rolling approach. }

Silver nanowires (AgNWs) have already been used as conductive networks. However, once a traditional polymer is broken, the conductive network is subsequently destroyed. Integrating high pressure sensitivity and repeatable self-healing capability into flexible strain sensors represents new advances for high performance strain sensing. Herein, superflexible 3D architectures are fabricated by sandwiching a layer of AgNWs decorated self-healing polymer between two layers of polydimethylsiloxane, which exhibit good stability, self-healability, and stretchability. For better mechanical properties, the self-healing polymer is reinforced with carbon fibers (CFs). The sensors based on self-healing polymer and AgNWs conductive network show high conductivity and excellent ability to repair both mechanical and electrical damage. They can detect different human motions accurately such as bending and recovering of the forearm and shank, the changes of palm, fist, and fingers. The fracture tensile stress of the reinforced self-healing polymer (9 wt% CFs) is increased to 10.3 MPa with the elongation at break of 8%. The stretch/release responses under static and dynamic loads of the sensor have a high sensitivity, large sensing range, excellent reliability, and remarkable stability.},
